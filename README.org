** TODO  Make sure the given pentagon is a convex pentagon. [ ]

** TODO Tile the given tile for all possibilities of a primitive tile  for just two of the tiles. [ ]

**  Pentagons
There can be regular and irregular pentagons. Regular Pentagons have
all there sides of equal length and all the angles of equal
measure. For any pentagon the sum of its angles should be equal to
540 ° (3 x 180 °).
The pentagons we will be dealing with will have *9* variables or
properties to define it.
- The *5* sides.
- Each of the *4* angles. (The fifth angle can be easily calculated)
First, to prove a pentagon cannot form a regular tiling (one in which
all faces are congruent, thus requiring that all the polygons be
pentagons), observe that 360° / 108° = 3 1⁄3 (where 108° Is the
interior angle), which is not a whole number; hence there exists no
integer number of pentagons sharing a single vertex and leaving no
gaps between them.

This is what the corresponding angles and sides looks like in an
image:

** Usability
- The compiler used is *gcc version 5.4.0 20160609*
- Requires C++11 or higher

To test out ~cd~ to ~src~ folder, then run the ~Makefile~ with the ~make~
command(You should have ~g++~ installed ofc).

Then you can run the main executable object with ~./test~ command.

** Exception error codes
- *101* Invalid tile Exception
