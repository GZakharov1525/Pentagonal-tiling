** Preface

Here I am trying to develop a fit function, which can be coupled
together with any Differential Evolution / Optimization algorithm out
there to find possible solutions for pentagonal tiling.

You can generate 3 executables by compiling this source code.
- =main.exe= - Runs the fit function alone.
- =run_tests.exe= - Runs unit tests to see if things are not broken.
- =run_de.exe= - Runs the optimization algorithm which is coupled with my fit function.

*PS:* As of now for the optimization algorithm to run, you need to move
the =input_data= folder to the directory where you are running the
=run_de.exe= executable.

The source is written C++ and is developed to be build and compile on
any platform or environment that supports C++.

** Dependencies

- [[https://www.cgal.org/][CGAL]] - As a helper library for tackling polygons.
- [[http://www.boost.org/][Boost]] - *CGAL requires boost*, I am also using Boost for Unit Testing.
- [[https://cmake.org/][CMake]] - Required to build the source code for your platform.

PS: In linux CGAL to work you also require to install =libcgal-qt5-dev=

** Building the source code

Source code Follows C++11 standard.

*** On Windows
Source code supports Visual Studio 2010 or later.

[[https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/installation.html][Make sure the dependencies are installed]]

To build a =.sln= file.
- *cd* to *src* directory, run cmake for the respected architecture.
- Open the =.sln= file and build =run_tests= or =main= or =run_de=
- =main.exe= requires parameters so try running that from the command line.
- Executables can be found in the =Debug= or =Release= Directory in the
  build directory, depending on your build setup.

*** On Linux
Source code requires G++ 6.0 or later.

[[https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/installation.html][Make sure the dependencies are installed]] and also =libcgal-qt5-dev=

To build a =MakeFile=.
- *cd* to *src* directory.
- Run =cmake=

Now run =make= to build the executables. 3 executables should be generated.
