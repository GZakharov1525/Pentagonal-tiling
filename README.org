**  Pentagons
There can be regular and irregular pentagons. Regular Pentagons have
all there sides of equal length and all the angles of equal
measure. For any pentagon the sum of its angles should be equal to
540 ° (3 x 180 °).
The pentagons we will be dealing with will have *9* variables or
properties to define it.
- The *5* sides.
- Each of the *4* angles. (The fifth angle can be easily calculated)

** Usability
- The compiler used is *gcc version 5.4.0 20160609*
- Requires C++11 or higher
